# How to make contributions to the ExploreML-Julia

It would be appreciated if you follow these steps if you wish to contribute to this repository : 

### DO s :

- Fork the repository.
- Don't work on the master branch.Create you seperate branch from the local forked repository with and appropriate name.For eg: If you are planning to add your hand written model of (k-means Clustering)  to this repository make a branch name like `add_k_means_clustering`.
- If you are working on a issue(listed or unlisted) you should inform the members before working on that issue. It saves your effort from duplicate PRs and conflicting interests in the future.If the issue is listed, you can just ask to work on the issue.If you find some problem in the notebooks or docs or wish to add a new tutorial, just create an issue in the main repository and ask to work on it.If your issue is legit, a member will assign you to work on that issue.

- After you are done with your code in your local repository, you can make a pull request to the main repository from that branch.

- After you are done with the steps above, a `member` will review and possibly merge your code.


### DONT s : 

- Don't make a pull request before you are assgined with that issue.For references you can go back to the 3rd step in the DO's.
